# Deutsch Spirits Hub - Updated Campaign Plan
## Campaign Duration: December 2024 - February 2026
## Last Updated: December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the Deutsch Spirits Hub featuring **Bib & Tucker** bourbon and **Redemption** whiskey. The hub serves as a dynamic marketing platform for Whisky Advocate in partnership with Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, updated throughout the campaign with seasonal content, cocktail recipes, and brand storytelling.

**Key Insight:** Both brands share a heritage story rooted in American whiskey history—Bib & Tucker channels the Gilded Age spirit of the 1880s, while Redemption champions the pre-Prohibition rye revival. This creates a compelling narrative of American whiskey's past and present.

### Bib & Tucker

**Brand Positioning:** "Where Bold and Refined Come Together"

**Heritage Story:** Named after the colloquial expression for "finest attire," Bib & Tucker draws inspiration from the turn-of-the-century American era (1880s).

Crafts bourbons "worthy of your finest moments" for life's grand adventures.

### Redemption
